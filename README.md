# Shell Script exercises from Trybe course #

In this exercise the proposal was to make many different Shell Scripts and go through different commands to solve some problems. There was seven exercises and 3 bonus exercises that i will comment below.

# Exercise 1 :

At this one I just write an simple Shell Script that print "Shell Script é demais!" at the screen.

# Exercise 2 :

Here I should make an string defined as an variable with value "Shell Script com variáveis é demais!" and print the variable value with echo.

# Exercise 3 :

Here I write an Shell Script that takes the command hostname and set it as an variable, than I print the message ("Este script está rodando no computador:" + the hostname saved as an variable)

# Exercise 4 :

First I've saved the file path as an variable FILE
Second I verified if the file path exists with an IF condition. Once it was verified as an existent file path I should print an message "O caminho $FILE está habilitado".
Then I've done an second IF condition to verify if I had the WRITE permission and if I had it I should print the message "Você tem permissão para editar $FILE", if I didn't had been able to WRITE at the file, then I should print the message "Você NÃO foi autorizado a editar $FILE".

# Exercise 5 :

Here I wrote a Shell Script that ask the user to input a directoryf or file path and then print at the screen if it is an file, a directory or another kind of file. Then, perform a listing command on the file/directory using the detailed listing option.

# Exercise 6 :

The propose was to modify the precious exercise in a way to accept the file/directory as an argument rather than ask to the user.

# Exercise 7 :

An Shell Script that recives a directory as an argument. If the argument it's not a directory, show the message "O argumento _ não é um diretório!".
If the argument is a directory, count how many files exists in it and show the following message "O (argument) tem (counted files) arquivos."

# Exercise 1 - Bonus :

A Shell Script that print the words "shell", "script", "usando", "estrutura", "repetição", "for", "terminal". One word per line.

# Exercise 2 - Bonus :

Modify script from exercise #6 to accept an unlimited number of files or directories as an argument.

# Exercise 3 - Bonus :

Write a Shell Script that renames all files in the current directory that end in ".png", so that the file name starts with the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
